# SRCL

**[Live Demo](https://sacred.computer)**

A open source monospace component library crafted for React interfaces built with variable fonts, React applications, and React websites that prioritize simplicity.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:10000` in your browser of choice.

Enjoy! The template uses `10000` as our `port` for more compatibility with [Render.com](https://render.com)

### Scripts (Optional)

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```
